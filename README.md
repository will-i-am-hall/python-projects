Various Python projects I've done.

  cardpull.py: Takes the name of a Magic: the Gathering (MTG) card and displays the card art along with relevant information.

  dc2.py: Second version of a deck converter (hence "dc2"); takes .dck files made for uses with XMage MTG client and turns them into .txt files ready for use in price checking or other MTG game clients.

  wave.py: A demonstration of damped harmonic oscillation, with sliders for amplitude, frequency, damping coefficient, and vertical offset.
